# build-os

This directory contains the long-term product planning and system scaffolding for both human and agent contributors.

## Structure

- `designer-os/`: Visual design system, layout cards, tokens, and UI/UX planning
- `architect-os/`: System-level specs, logic planning, workflows, and stack decisions

Both folders are used as shared truth by humans and Antigravity agents via rules and workflows.

See `.agent/rules` and `.agent/workflows` for how these documents are referenced and consumed.
